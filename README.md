# FlipperIRDB
This is just my cancerous version of the Universal Remote from flipper zero.

# What is this?
So basically I took everything from [Lucaslhm IRDB](https://github.com/Lucaslhm/Flipper-IRDB) and combined every single TV infared file into 1 giant one to replace the old TV.ir file.

# Important
Now keep in mind this is probably the worst way to do this. But I did it out of fun. And bordem. Honestly I dont know if this can break your flipper so keep the use to a minimum.
